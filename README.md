 Property Rental Solution

 Hey, for this solution to work you firslty need a correct database. in the appsettings.json file in the main directory.

 I have set this up to work with Maria DB. Make sure to update the ip address along the passwords, db name and usernames.

Once you have your DB up and running the your settings have been amended, you need to update your database. If you are using a Package Manager in Visual Studio, you can run the following command.

Update-Database

You will then need to build your solution. If things went ok you should have a working solution. 


Further word of warning.

The appsettings.json file has been added to the .gitignore list. If you want this file to update, make sure you also remove this.
